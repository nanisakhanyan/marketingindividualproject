# Pyrthon package for RFM and Customer segmentation. 

To develop customer loyalty and selecting profitable clients it is important to identify customer segments. RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis is a simple technique for behavior based customer segmentation. By examining three categories which are:
How recently a customer has purchased (recency),
How often they purchase (frequency),
How much the customer spends (monetary) 
one can understand which customer is the most valuable one.
